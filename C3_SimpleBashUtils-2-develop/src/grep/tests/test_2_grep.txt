Thompson wrote the first version in PDP-11 assembly language to help Lee E. McMahon analyse the text of the Federalist Papers to determine the authorship of each paper. The text editor ed (also written by Thompson) had support for regular expressions, but could not be used on such a large amount of text, so Thompson extracted this code into a standalone tool. He chose the name because in ed, the command g/re/p would print all lines matching a given pattern.
grep was first included in version 4 of Unix. Noting that it is "generally cited as the prototypical software tool", McIlroy credited grep with "irrevocably entrenching" Thompson's tool philosophy in Unix.
